This repository contains the code for the PopulationGraphs, an iOS/visionOS/MacOS application for the maintenance, archiving, analysis, and communication of landscape and population genetic data within population graphs.

This software was created to support the research conducted in the [DyerLab](https://dyerlab.org).
